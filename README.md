# hermes
A Grails plugin providing guaranteed one-time delivery capabilities for HTTP requests

Documentation is available on GitHub.

## This Repo

This is a multi-project build for testing purposes.  The plugin itself is housed in `hermes-plugin`.  In order to
effectively test a Grails plugin, one must create a full-fledged Grails app that installs the plugin and test it there.
Unit tests are supported within the plugin itself, but integration tests are not.  Hence, the integration testing app is
housed in `hermes-integration-test-app`.

Please see the READMEs in their respective folders for more information and instructions.
